# IsometricAnalyzer

A Labview program to analyze isometric squat and isometric mid thigh pull files from a force plate. Currently able to import and parse csv files with comma or tab separation.

## Getting Started

**If you have Labview 2016 or newer installed:**  
The primary parent folder contains the source code for the main Labview Project and Primary VI "Main.vi". If you're interested in seeing the source, you can fork/pull/download the entire repository to view/use/edit. You will need a full version of Labview 2016 or newer to use.

**If you don't have Labview 2016 installed:**  
The folder "Builds" contains the "Isometric Analyzer.exe" and all of the primary dependencies for running said executable, with the exception of Labview Runtime 2016. You will need to first download and install Labview Runtime 2016 to be able to run the executable. It can be found here: http://www.ni.com/download/labview-run-time-engine-2016/6066/en/
